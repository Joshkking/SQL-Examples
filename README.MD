# SQL-Examples Readme

This was my answer to SQL not having a convenient notebook style similar to Jupyer Notebooks. The markdown file in this repository should explain everything, but essentially a created my own database schema on db-fiddle and then wrote a heck ton of SQL queries against it to serve as both my own practice and a guide notebook for learning SQL. The dialect is MySQL and the link to the fiddle is provided within, so maybe it helps someone out there!
