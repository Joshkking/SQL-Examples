# SQL-Examples Readme

This was my answer to SQL not having a convenient notebook style similar to Jupyer Notebooks. The markdown file in this repository should explain everything, but essentially I created my own database schema on db-fiddle and then wrote a heck ton of SQL queries against it to serve as both my own practice and a guide notebook for learning SQL. The dialect is MySQL and the link to the fiddle is provided within, so maybe it helps someone out there!

If you're note familiar with markdown (MD) files, don't worry- Just click on the file and Github will draw a preview with working links for you!
